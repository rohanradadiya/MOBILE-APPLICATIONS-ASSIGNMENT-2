ROHAN RADADIYA - MOBILE APPLICATIONS ASSIGNMENT 2 - LOCATIONFINDER APPLICATION/SYSTEM

- Different functionalities: Adding, deleting, and modifying locations
- 100 pre-existing locations throughout the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) exist in the database, coded into the application. Further locations can be added, deleted, or modified right on the Android Studio emulator.
- When adding a location, no fields can be blank (address, latitude, or longitude), or the user will see a pop-up message on the screen.
- When doing a query search, the user must input the exact same address that was initially there, including characters and capitalizations/lowercases.

A sample location which can be searched using the query search functionality:
- 1300 Queen Street West, Toronto; Latitude: 43.6517; Longitude: -79.4406;

So, the user can do a query search, and in the address, they must exactly input 1300 Queen Street West, Toronto, and the latitudes and longitudes of 43.6517 and -79.4406 will show up on the screen respectively.
